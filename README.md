# Monster duel

A demonstration of the last riddle of [this TED video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn1mjuVXNEI).  
  
Every round the hero try to win the two challenges three times, each time with a different monster (that can be A, B or C). The screen will display the current round and the monster's wins / total rounds. The program will stop at 2.000.000 rounds. You will see that the numbers will pretty much coincide with the calculated probabilities.
